        48. JavaScript Constant:
            JavaScript constants are values that are fixed for example in this script.
            We're adding two values 10 and 5 together and outputting the result in a paragraph with the id math. The values that we're adding are fixed values 10 and 5 the value of these numbers is not dependent on any other factor. The 10 will always be 10 and the 5 will always be 5 unless we change them in the script.

            Constant can be in the form of numbers both whole and integer or strings, strings are written in within double or single quotes.
